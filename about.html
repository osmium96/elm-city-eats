		<h2>introduction</h2>
			<p type="citation"> 
				The question of where to eat may seem innocent at first glance, but it's not. Achieving the perfect dining experience isn't about eating at the fanciest place or spending a ton of money. Different restaurants work for different situations. In the quest to eat at the perfect place for a given night, there is a lot to consider: cost, cuisine, group size, day of the week, occasion, <em>vibe</em>, and more. It may be too ambitious of a task for me to take on completely, but I'll take a stab at it (try out the restaurant selector below).

				This page will host my reviews of New Haven restaurants. I'll share my thoughts about places I've eaten at with the hopes that it'll make your decision a little easier. I'm still experimenting on style so bear with me, as the content may update or change after initial posting. <br><br>
				Don't worry, I'll skip all the pizza places.
