		<h1>introduction</h1>

		<p type="main">
				The question of where to eat may seem innocent at first glance, but it's not. Achieving the perfect dining experience isn't about eating at the fanciest place or spending a ton of money. Different restaurants work for different situations. In the quest to eat at the perfect place for a given night, there is a lot to consider: cost, cuisine, group size, day of the week, occasion, <em>vibe</em>, and more. It may be too ambitious of a task for me to take on completely, but I'll take a stab at it (try out the restaurant selector below). 
				<br><br>
				This site will host <a href = "eats.html">my reviews of New Haven restaurants</a>. I'll share my thoughts about places I've eaten at with the hopes that it'll make your decision a little easier. I will also occasionally recommend restaurants <a href = "travels.html">outside of the elm city</a>. I'm still experimenting on style so bear with me, as the content may update or change after initial posting. <br><br>
				Don't worry, I'll skip all the pizza places.
